# INTRODUCTION
  This repo is a multiplayer coding game prototype using Unity3D. Our idea originate from a phenmomenon in our University's Python course, where a lots of student are unable to do well on class. Thus, we brainstorming together and come out a multiplayer coding game prototype, where student can train their python skill inside the game.
